# Tcf21Interstitial
Three types of scRNA-seq experiments for Leydig regeneration from Tcf21+ Interstitial: 
1. Chemical ablation of Leydig
2. Genetic ablation of Leydig
3. In-vitro leydig differentiation from Tcf21+ Interstitial
This site contains scripts for scRNA-seq analysis of in-vitro Leydig Differentiation from Tcf21+ Interstitial.
